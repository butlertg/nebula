//! The QUICK PROMPT's last step: the box's `QuickLaunch` plus the typed
//! text, turned into the create the DAEMON sees. A launch into a selected
//! WORKTREE is one `CreateAgent`. A launch into a worktree that does not
//! exist yet (`QuickTarget::NewWorktree` — `p` on the WORKTREES PANEL) is
//! a `CreateWorktree` first, the launch riding its PENDING INTENT, and
//! the same `CreateAgent` once the Ack names the checkout: retargeted at
//! it, the cursor moved onto its row, FOCUS left on the panel `p` was
//! pressed in. Both rows are on screen from the moment Enter is pressed —
//! stand-ins (`placeholder`) that the Acks turn into the real rows.
