//! The shape a pull request row takes in either sidebar panel — the `↗`
//! glyph, the `#42 title` label and a trailing badge — and how a draft, a
//! merged and a closed pull request are told apart from an open one. The
//! PROJECT OPEN PRS GROUP (WORKTREES PANEL) and the PR ROW (SESSIONS PANEL)
//! both build their spans here, so the two lists read as one.
