# How Nebula works

Nebula is a tmux-style terminal multiplexer for AI coding agents. You run multiple Claude / Codex / Cursor CLI sessions across git repos and worktrees, and they keep running after you close the UI.

## Process model

There are two processes, same binary:

1. **Daemon** (`nebula daemon`) — owns every PTY, SQLite, git worktrees, and agent status. Lives in the background.
2. **TUI** (`nebula`) — a ratatui client. Quit it and nothing dies; relaunch and scrollback is replayed.

On launch the TUI connects to a unix socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nebula/daemon.sock`, mode `0700`). If nothing is listening, it spawns `nebula daemon` in its own session (`setsid`) so the daemon outlives the client, does not get Ctrl+C, and holds no controlling terminal — daemon subprocesses that run the user's interactive shell must not be able to reach the TUI's tty via `/dev/tty`.

IPC is length-prefixed MessagePack: the client sends `ClientRequest`s (CRUD, attach, keystrokes, resize); the daemon pushes `ServerEvent`s (entity deltas, status, PTY output).

## Domain tree

Everything is nested:

**Workspace** (a named project group) → **Project** (a git repo) → **Worktree** (main checkout or `git worktree add`) → **Session** (an agent *or* a plain terminal tab).

Exactly one workspace is *open* at a time — daemon-global state, switched with `nebula workspace open <name>` or the TUI's `w` picker and broadcast to every client. The TUI scopes its Projects panel and `/` search to the open workspace; other workspaces' sessions keep running (and keep receiving status updates) in the background. Every install starts with the built-in `default` workspace, and `nebula add` files new projects under whichever workspace is open.

Worktrees are real git worktrees, created under `<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>`. The daemon also polls git metadata so worktrees created outside Nebula still show up.

An agent is a PTY running `claude`, `codex`, or `cursor-agent` in that worktree. Restart uses `--resume <session-id>` when one is stored.

Persistence is SQLite at `~/.local/share/nebula/nebula.db`: workspaces (one flagged open), projects, worktrees, agents (kind + CLI session id), links, last UI selection.

Worktrees also carry a **link list**: URLs pinned to a checkout — the pull request, the ticket, the design doc. They're stored (daemon-side, URL normalized to http(s) on the way in) and shown as their own LINKS group in the Sessions panel, where `Enter` hands one to the browser. Above them sits a row nothing stores: the pull request on that branch, looked up client-side with `gh pr view` on the git-poll tick and cached per worktree. That row opens like the rest but can't be edited or deleted — it comes back from git on the next lookup. A saved link that matches the detected PR is shown once, as the pull-request row.

```

**Attach path:** TUI sends `Attach { session, from_seq, cols, rows }`. Daemon replays the PTY ring as `Scrollback`, then streams live `Output`. Keystrokes go the other way as `Input`. Detach does not kill the child.

**Status path (not MCP):** at spawn, Nebula writes managed hooks into the worktree (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, or `.cursor/hooks.json`). Those hooks `curl` a loopback HTTP server with a per-boot bearer token. Events like `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `PermissionRequest`, `SubagentStart` feed a status machine that maps to the colored dots (running / finished / needs feedback / …). Stop is gated on active subagents so a turn is not marked done while workers are still going. Claude and Codex share one hooks dialect; Cursor speaks its own (camelCase events like `beforeSubmitPrompt`/`stop`, flat `{"command"}` entries, JSON replies on stdout), so its installer translates event names into the `hookEvent` query param and the receiver aliases its payload fields (`conversation_id` → session id, first `workspace_roots` entry → cwd). Cursor has no permission-request hook and runs with `--force`, so cursor agents report busy/idle but never needs-feedback.

**Auto-title path (hooks again, still not MCP):** a session created with the default `agent-N` name carries a store-only `auto_title_pending` flag. While it's set, the daemon answers the Claude/Codex `UserPromptSubmit` hook POST with an instruction body instead of the usual discarded JSON — the installer's `UserPromptSubmit` command (alone among the hooks) pipes the response to stdout, which those CLIs add to the model's context. The instruction tells the agent to run `nebula rename <3-4 word title>` once; that subcommand resolves the agent from `NEBULA_AGENT_ID`, does a one-shot IPC `AutoRenameAgent`, and the daemon applies it only while the flag is still pending (atomic conditional update), so a user rename — which clears the flag — always wins and repeated attempts get a polite "already titled" error. Claude also gets a `Bash(nebula rename:*)` entry merged into `permissions.allow` so the command runs unprompted; Codex/Cursor already run with `--yolo`/`--force`. Cursor's hooks can't inject context, so it gets a managed, env-guarded `.cursor/rules/nebula-title.mdc` project rule carrying the same instruction — safe to fire repeatedly because the daemon-side flag is the arbiter.

**Task-run records:** a run is not just a status line — the whole point of an unattended one is that nobody watched it. Starting a run inserts a `task_runs` row and snapshots the working tree onto `refs/nebula/runs/<run>/base` (plumbing only, exactly like `commit_on_finish`'s branch: HEAD, the index, and the files are untouched); ending it — completion, stall, question, or a dead session, all of which funnel through the one `end_task_run` — writes `…/head`, diffs the pair, and renders `report.md` into `<data>/task-runs/<slug>/<stamp>-<id>/`. Diffing base-to-head rather than HEAD-to-tree is what keeps somebody else's uncommitted work out of the run's numbers. Alongside the report sits `transcript.log` — the raw PTY byte stream, tee'd from the same `flush` that feeds the scrollback ring and capped at 32 MiB, because the ring is a megabyte of memory that dies with the daemon — and `summary.md`, which the run's *last* iteration is asked (in the prompt itself) to write in its own words. Clients never read those files directly: `ListTaskRuns` / `GetTaskRunArtifact` / `GetTaskRunDigest` go over the same socket as everything else, so a TUI on the far end of an ssh hop sees the daemon host's disk, and local wall-clock stamps are rendered daemon-side for the same reason `next_run_at` is. The Automation pane shows the history under each task's fields; `nebula runs`, `nebula runs show`, and `nebula runs digest` are the same three requests from a shell.

**Metrics path:** the memory modal (`Shift+M`) asks the daemon for one reading (`GetMetrics` → `Metrics`). The daemon runs a single machine-wide `ps` sweep and sums RSS over each live session's process subtree (the PTY child plus its descendants — an agent CLI fans out into workers and MCP servers), reporting itself separately since sessions are its own descendants. The TUI adds its own RSS client-side (it is not a daemon child) and re-polls every 2s while the modal is open.

**Remote hosts path:** `nebula ssh host [dir]` execs `ssh -t` with a self-installing remote command, and first records the destination in `~/.local/share/nebula/ssh_hosts.json` (newest first, capped at 20, keyed by host + start dir). The TUI's `h` picker lists that file; choosing an entry — or typing a new `user@host [dir]` with `a` — quits the TUI cleanly (UI state saved, terminal restored) and hands the destination back to the binary, which execs a fresh `nebula ssh` over the same terminal. The local daemon and its sessions keep running; exiting the remote nebula lands back in the local shell. `d` in the picker forgets an entry.

**Browser path:** `nebula browser` shells out to [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) rather than serving anything itself — ttyd runs a command in a PTY and bridges it to xterm.js in the page, so pointing it at this binary (`current_exe`, not whatever `nebula` resolves to on PATH) puts the real TUI in a browser tab, sidebar and all. The command polls `127.0.0.1:<port>` until it accepts, opens the URL, then blocks on ttyd; Ctrl+C reaches both through the shared process group. It binds loopback and stays unauthenticated deliberately — ttyd ships no auth and what it serves is a live terminal, so remote access is `ssh -L` or a tunnel, never a wider bind. The daemon is uninvolved: this is a second TUI client like any other, so it obeys the same one-open-workspace rule.

## Crate layout

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| `nebula` | Thin CLI: no args → TUI; `daemon`, `kill`, `rename`, `upgrade`, `ssh`, `browser` |
| `nebula-core` | Shared protocol, entities, IDs, paths, codec |
| `nebula-daemon` | PTYs, SQLite, git, hook receiver, status engine |
| `nebula-tui` | ratatui UI, keyboard/mouse, attach/scrollback |

The TUI also has extras on top of the multiplexer: git diff viewer, grep, a vim-like terminal overlay, fuzzy finders — those are client-side. The daemon is the source of truth for sessions and the tree.

**Mental model:** tmux, but the “windows” are agent CLIs bound to git worktrees, and the sidebar is a mission-control view of which agents are working, waiting, or dead.
