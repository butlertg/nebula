## Why nebula

You start three agents in three terminal tabs. Five minutes later you have no idea which one is waiting
on a permission prompt, which one finished, and which one is still thinking — so you tab through all
three, every time, and read the screens.

nebula replaces that with a tree and a color:

- **Every project, worktree and agent in one list.** Four columns, `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` to move, `Enter` to drill in.
- **A dot per session that says what it's doing.** ● yellow is mid-turn, ● violet is done and waiting
  to be read, ● green is done and read, ● red wants you. Parents roll up their children, so a red dot
  on a collapsed project tells you exactly where to look without opening anything.
- **A daemon that owns the PTYs.** Quit the UI, close the laptop lid, come back tomorrow — the agents
  never stopped, and your scrollback is replayed.
- **Real git worktrees, one keystroke.** Two agents in two directories don't collide.
- **Work that runs itself.** Give a project a task — a prompt, a cron schedule, and how many turns to
  keep going for — and the daemon starts the session at 02:00 and re-prompts it turn after turn with
  nobody watching. `e` opens the tab.
- **Every open pull request under them, readable in place.** Open a project and nebula asks `gh` what's
  still open on the repo. Hover one to read its description and comments in the pane, `g` for its diff,
  `Enter` for the browser.

No Electron, no server, no MCP. One ~4 MB Rust binary and a unix socket.

## Install

macOS or Linux — the same command installs and updates:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AgentSystemLabs/nebula/main/install.sh | sh
```

It downloads the prebuilt binary for your platform from the latest GitHub release into `~/.local/bin`
(override with `NEBULA_INSTALL_DIR`), falling back to `cargo install --git` when no release matches.

Afterwards, `nebula upgrade` runs that same script for you. It refuses to clobber a local `cargo build`
(pass `--force` if you mean it). Upgrading while a daemon is running is safe: sessions keep running on
the old binary until you `nebula kill` and relaunch.

> **Prerequisite:** at least one agent CLI on your `PATH` — `claude`, `codex`, or `cursor-agent`.
> nebula spawns them; it doesn't ship them.

## Quickstart

**1. Add a repo.** nebula is project-first, and a project is just a git checkout:

```sh
nebula add ~/code/my-app       # or, from inside the repo: nebula add .
```

**2. Open the TUI.** A bare `nebula` launches it and auto-starts the daemon:

```sh
nebula
```

Four columns, left to right: **Projects → Worktrees → Sessions → Terminal**. `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` (or
`h` / `l`, or `←` / `→`) move focus between columns, `j` / `k` move the selection inside one, and `Enter`
drills in.
With no projects yet you get the splash instead — press `n` to add one without leaving the TUI.

**3. Choose where the agent runs.** Select your project, then a worktree. Every project starts with one:
the checkout itself. Press `n` in the Worktrees column to branch off into a real `git worktree` (created
under `<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>`). That's the point of the column — two agents in two
worktrees edit two directories and never collide. Or skip the column and just ask: tell a Claude session
"do this in a worktree" and it creates one through nebula and moves itself into it (see *How it works*).

Under the checkouts, an `OPEN PRS` group lists every pull request still open on the repo — drafts
included, badged as such — fetched with `gh` when you open the project and re-asked about once a minute
(one `gh pr list` per project, so a repo with a hundred open PRs still costs one API call). That beat is
also how rows retire: merge or close a pull request and it stops coming back, so it leaves the list on
its own, and the one under your cursor goes the moment GitHub says it's merged. Rest the cursor on one
and the right-hand pane reads it to you — description, stats and the whole conversation — without
leaving nebula; `g` opens its diff in the same viewer your worktree diffs use, `Enter` or a double-click
opens it in the browser, and `/` finds it by title. Only the row you actually stop on is fetched.

**4. Start the agent.** With a worktree selected, press `n` in the Sessions column. A menu asks what to
run — **Claude**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, or a plain **Terminal (shell)**. `→` on Claude or Codex drills
into model and reasoning-effort submenus; `Enter` anywhere takes your configured defaults. On the
Claude row, `Tab` toggles Cloud mode: after the optional name, enter the task in the wrapped editor
(`Shift+Enter` or `Ctrl+J` adds a line) and nebula launches `claude --cloud <task>`. On accounts without
Claude's live-attach rollout the CLI prints the session URL and exits; nebula keeps the session id it printed
(the row gets a `cloud` badge) so you never need the browser to get back in: **Restart** the row — or pick
**Attach cloud session** from its menu — and nebula runs `claude --cloud <id>`, falling back to
`claude --teleport <id>` (the transcript and branch pulled into a local session) when the account can't attach.
Either way the CLI switches the checkout to the cloud branch, so a row still in the main checkout is first
re-homed into a `cloud-<id>` worktree of its own. Otherwise, name the session or
accept the default and nebula spawns the CLI in that worktree and drops you straight into it.

**5. Leave — it keeps running.** `Ctrl+q` gets you out of the terminal and back to the panels. That's the
key to remember: the agent doesn't care that you stopped watching. Press `q` to quit nebula entirely and
the daemon still owns every PTY — come back with `nebula` an hour later and each session is where you
left it, scrollback replayed.

**6. Read the dots instead of the screens.** Once you're running more than one agent you stop reading
terminals and start reading the Sessions column. Full table under [Status dots](#status-dots).

**7. Let them name themselves.** Leave a new session on its default name and the agent retitles it after
your first prompt — `Fix Login Redirect` rather than `agent-3`. Type a name yourself (or `r` to rename)
and nebula never touches it.

From there: `t` opens a shell in the selected worktree, `/` fuzzy-jumps to any workspace, project,
worktree, session or open pull request by name — across every workspace, not just the open one, so
picking a hit somewhere else switches you there on the way — `w` switches this window's workspace when
one project list gets long (each nebula instance keeps its own — run two, on two workspaces, side by
side) and `Shift+W` shows or hides the Workspaces bar across the top, where every workspace is a tab
carrying the rolled-up status of the agents under it, `s` opens settings, `?` lists every key, and `m`
(or right-click) opens a context menu for whatever's selected.

## Status dots

| Dot | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ● gray | fresh — agent never run |
| ● yellow | running — turn in progress (Stop is gated on active subagents) |
| ● violet | done, unread — turn complete and nobody has looked at it yet |
| ● green | done, read — same finished turn, once the cursor has been on the session |
| ● red | needs feedback — permission prompt or question waiting on you |
| ● magenta | terminated — process died mid-run |
| ○ | disconnected — daemon restarted while the agent was live |

Worktree and project rows roll up their children: red beats yellow beats done, and a parent's dot is
violet whenever anything unread finished under it — so the violet walks up the tree and turns green as
you read your way down it.

A dot going violet while you were looking elsewhere is easy to miss, so nebula counts those for you:
when a running (or red) session finishes a turn that isn't in the pane on screen, its worktree and
project rows grow a violet `n done` badge — the number of terminals you have left to go read — and the
session row itself says `done` where its harness name normally sits. Walking the cursor onto a session
previews it, which reads it: the badges count down as you go and disappear at zero. The flag lives in
the daemon, so it survives closing the TUI and is shared by every client; a turn that finishes in the
pane you're already looking at never counts.

## Working a worktree

The panels aren't the only view. With a worktree selected, from any panel:

| Key | View |
|---|---|
| **`g`** | **Git diff.** Changed files down the left, the diff on the right, with a live fuzzy filter. On an open-PR row it shows that pull request's diff instead, fetched whole with `gh pr diff`. `Ctrl+r` marks a file reviewed ✓ and sinks it to the bottom — nebula-side bookkeeping only, no git state is touched — and every mark clears itself when HEAD moves or the file changes again, so what's left unticked is genuinely what you haven't read. |
| **`f`** | **Find file.** Fuzzy finder over the worktree. `Enter` opens the file in an editor modal (vim by default; the `editor` setting or `NEBULA_EDITOR` picks another), `Ctrl+y` copies the path — ready to paste into an agent. |
| **`F`** | **Find in files.** `git grep` into the same modal; `Enter` opens the hit at its line. |
| **`b`** | **File tree browser.** Tree on the left, syntax-highlighted preview on the right, and an always-live filter that narrows the tree to matching files and the directories holding them. |
| **`l`** | **Links.** Pin a PR, doc or ticket URL to the worktree; it shows up in the Sessions panel's LINKS group. nebula also finds the pull request already open on the branch with `gh` and lists it there on its own, with a count of the comments that landed while you were away. |
| **`p`** | **Pin.** Pinned worktrees and agents sort to the top of their panel and are spared by the idle reaper. |

## How it works

- **Detached daemon (tmux-style).** A background `nebula` daemon owns every PTY, so agents keep running
  when the TUI closes. The TUI is a client that attaches over a unix socket (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nebula/`
  or `/tmp/nebula-<uid>/`, mode 0700). Quit the TUI, relaunch later, and your sessions are still alive
  with scrollback replayed.
- **Projects → worktrees → sessions.** All work happens in the main checkout or a git worktree.
  Worktrees are real (`git worktree add/remove`), created under
  `<repo>/../<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>`.
- **Agents boot `claude`, `codex`, or `cursor-agent`.** Creating an agent (`n`) first asks which CLI to
  run, then spawns it in the worktree. Claude's picker can also dispatch a one-shot Cloud task as
  `claude --cloud <task>`; because Claude accepts that description as a process argument, don't put
  secrets in the Cloud task. Restored agents resume with `claude --resume <session-id>` /
  `codex resume <session-id>` / `cursor-agent --resume <session-id>` (falling back to a fresh session
  when the old one is gone).
- **Status via agent-CLI hooks, not MCP.** At agent spawn, nebula merges managed hooks into the
  worktree's `.claude/settings.local.json` (Claude Code) or `.cursor/hooks.json` (Cursor CLI), and into
  `~/.codex/hooks.json` (Codex — codex records hook approvals against the hook file's path, so a
  per-worktree file would re-prompt forever; from its home, you approve nebula's hooks once at codex's
  "Hooks need review" prompt and every later worktree is silent). Groups are tagged `_nebulaManaged`,
  user hooks preserved, rebuilt each spawn. Each hook is a fail-soft curl to the daemon's loopback HTTP
  endpoint, authenticated with a per-boot bearer token injected into the agent's environment only.
- **…plus the progress bar, for the cancel no hook reports.** Escaping out of a turn fires no `Stop` and
  suppresses the idle notification that normally un-sticks one, so nebula also reads the CLI's terminal
  progress-bar escapes (OSC 9;4) straight off the PTY. That signal survives a cancel, and it stays busy
  while a permission prompt is open — so it can't mark an agent done while it is actually waiting on you.
- **Sessions title themselves.** Create a session with the default name and the agent renames it after
  your first prompt — a 3-4 word title describing the ask (e.g. `Fix Login Redirect`), via a
  `nebula rename <title>` command the CLI runs in its own turn (no extra API calls, no MCP server).
  Claude Code and Codex get the instruction injected through the `UserPromptSubmit` hook response — as
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, the one envelope both read (the daemon sends it only while the
  session is untitled); Cursor gets a managed `.cursor/rules/nebula-title.mdc` project rule instead,
  since its hooks can't inject context. Titling is one-shot and never clobbers a name you typed or set
  with `r` — a late agent attempt is politely declined. `nebula rename --force` overrides.
- **Ask the agent for a worktree and it moves there.** Tell a Claude session "do this in a worktree" and
  it runs `nebula worktree <name>` instead of its own `EnterWorktree` tool (whose checkouts land under
  `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/` on a `worktree-*` branch). nebula creates the checkout in its usual
  `<repo-name>-worktrees/<branch>` spot — or takes the existing one for that branch — re-homes the
  session's row under it at once, and the moment that turn ends restarts the CLI resumed inside the
  worktree, opening with a note saying where it now runs, so the conversation carries on there without
  you typing anything. Claude learns the rule from a short `--append-system-prompt` nebula passes at
  spawn, plus a `Bash(nebula worktree:*)` permission so the command never prompts. Codex and Cursor
  sessions can run the same command; they resume silent and wait for your next prompt. The restart is
  the only way there: an agent CLI can't `cd` out of the directory it was started in.
- **Everything persists in SQLite** (`~/.local/share/nebula/nebula.db` or the platform equivalent):
  projects, worktrees, agents (with kind + CLI session ids), links, tasks, workspaces, pins, and your
  last selection.
- **Tasks run without you.** A task is a project-scoped prompt with a cron expression, an iteration
  count, and a target checkout (the root, one worktree, or a fresh one per task). A scheduler tick in the
  daemon starts the run — so it happens whether or not a TUI is open — and its prompt is *typed at the
  session*, as a bracketed paste followed by the submit key, which is why a slash command like
  `/code-review` runs exactly as it would for you and why codex and cursor work too. Each turn end
  (the `Stop` hook) feeds the next iteration until the count runs out; a run's session is pinned, so the
  idle reaper leaves it alone between turns. A missed window — the daemon was down at 02:00 — is skipped
  rather than fired late, so coming back online never launches a backlog at once. A task marked
  **unattended** launches Claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (codex and cursor already run with
  `--yolo` / `--force`), because a permission prompt with nobody there is a run that never finishes; it is
  off by default and per task.
- **Sessions warm up, then get reaped.** The daemon can pre-spawn an agent CLI while you're still naming
  the session, and pre-boot a worktree's dead sessions while your selection rests on it, so attaching
  lands on a booted screen instead of a booting shell. To bound what that costs, idle PTYs in worktrees
  no client is watching are killed after `session_idle_timeout` (5m by default) — pinned agents, working
  agents, ones waiting on you, and terminals with a command running are all spared, and a reaped agent
  revives on the next attach with its conversation resumed.
- **Settings live in one JSON file** (`config.json`, beside the database), read fresh on each use by both
  the daemon and the TUI, so hand edits apply without a restart. `s` opens the settings overlay over the
  same file: color theme, animations, focused-panel tint, whether the Workspaces bar is shown,
  editor, default model and reasoning effort per agent CLI, the RECENT window, the idle timeout, and
  whether new sessions stop to ask for a name. `R` inside the overlay puts every setting — hotkeys
  included — back to its default, after a confirmation.
- **Every panel key is rebindable.** The overlay's Hotkeys tab lists every action and what it answers to,
  and writes overrides into the same file (`"keybindings": {"git_diff": "ctrl+g, g"}`); an empty value
  unbinds. Because nebula is always a guest inside Terminal.app / Ghostty / tmux, the tab says at bind
  time when a chord probably won't survive the trip — `⌘` anything, `^⇧` without the kitty protocol,
  `^←` on stock macOS. `Ctrl+q` is the one exception to all of it: it unlocks a terminal no matter what
  you bind, since unbinding your way out would trap you in the session.

## Keys

Defaults — every one of them is rebindable in Settings → Hotkeys (`s`).

<details>
<summary><b>Full keymap</b> (click to expand)</summary>

<br>

| Context | Key | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Panels | `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`, `h/l` or `←/→`, `j/k` | move focus / selection |
| Panels | `Ctrl+→` | cross into the terminal pane without attaching (plain `l`/`→` stops at Sessions) |
| Panels | `Enter` | drill in; on a session: attach |
| Any panel | `/` | fuzzy jump across every workspace, project, worktree and session — in *every* workspace, each row pathed `workspace/project/branch/session`, so typing another workspace's name jumps you into it (`Ctrl+n/p` move, `Ctrl+o` opens the hit, `Ctrl+f` just lands the selection on it) |
| Projects | `n` / `d` | add project / remove from list |
| Any panel | `o` | add ("open") a project — same prompt as `n`, from any focus |
| Add project | type + `Tab`, `↓↑` / `→` / `←` | browse for the repo: type to filter (bash-style Tab completion), arrows pick a directory, `→` steps in, `←` steps up, `Enter` adds the highlighted (or typed) path; `●` marks git repos |
| Projects | `Shift+J/K` | move project up / down the list (`Shift+↑/↓` too, but Terminal.app never sends those) |
| Worktrees | `n` / `d` | new worktree / delete (typed confirm — deletes files) |
| New worktree | type a sentence, or `Enter` on the empty prompt | the branch name is slugified (`fix login redirect` → `fix-login-redirect`); empty takes a random `<adj>-<noun>-<verb>` |
| Worktrees / Sessions | `p` | pin / unpin — pinned rows sort to the top and skip the idle reaper |
| Sessions | `n` | new session (agent or shell terminal) |
| New session picker (Claude) | `Tab` | toggle Claude Cloud; Cloud adds a wrapped task prompt (`Shift+Enter` or `Ctrl+J` inserts a line) before launch |
| Sessions | `r`, `a`, `u`, `d`, `A` | rename, archive, unarchive, delete, toggle archived |
| Any panel | `Shift+D` | delete every row of the focused panel (confirm lists the casualties) |
| Any panel | `g` | git diff for the selected worktree: filter, `↑↓` files, `Shift+↑↓`/`PgUp/PgDn`/`Ctrl+d/u` scroll, `Ctrl+r` marks a file reviewed ✓ |
| Any panel | `Shift+G` | open the selected repo's page on its git host — the `origin` remote (`git@github.com:o/r.git`, `ssh://`, `https://`) turned into a browsable URL, credentials stripped |
| Any panel | `f` / `F` / `b` | find file / find in files (`git grep`) / file tree browser, all scoped to the selected worktree — `Enter` opens the file in an editor modal (at the matched line, for `F`); in `f` and `b`, `Ctrl+y` copies the path |
| Any panel | `Shift+L` | attach a link (pull request, doc, ticket) to the selected worktree — it lands in the Sessions panel's LINKS group, above any open pull request nebula finds with `gh` |
| Sessions | `Enter` / `r` / `d` on a link | open it in the browser / edit its URL / delete it (the detected pull request opens but can't be edited or deleted) |
| Any panel | `t` | new shell terminal in the selected worktree's directory (Projects panel: the repo root) |
| Any panel | `w` or click the `◇ workspace` nameplate bottom-left | workspace switcher: `Enter` opens, `n`/`r`/`d` create/rename/delete — delete asks first (the panels scope to the open workspace; `/` doesn't, and switches for you). Per window — switching here leaves your other nebula instances on the workspace you left them on |
| Any panel | `Shift+W` | show / hide the Workspaces bar across the top: `WORKSPACES` on the left, directly above `PROJECTS`, and one tab per workspace to its right with the rolled-up status of the agents under it (plus a count of the ones that finished unread), so a run in a workspace you don't have open still shows at the top level. The choice is remembered — it's the `Workspaces bar` setting, also in Settings → Appearance |
| Any panel | `1`–`9` (or `⌘1`–`⌘9`) | open that numbered tab in the Workspaces bar without leaving the panel you're in. `⌘` is what the tabs advertise, but Terminal.app and most other emulators never encode it into pty bytes — the bare digit is the one that always arrives. Rebindable per slot in Settings → Hotkeys |
| Workspaces | `←/→`, `↓`/`Enter`, `n`/`r`/`d`, `m` | the cursor is the open workspace, so `←/→` switches; `↓` or `Enter` steps down into Projects; create / rename / delete the open one (delete asks first, and refuses a non-empty workspace); `m` or right-click lists the same verbs |
| Any panel | `Shift+H` | ssh hosts: every `nebula ssh` destination, newest first. `Enter`/click reconnects (quits this TUI and execs a fresh `nebula ssh` — local sessions keep running), `a` types a new `user@host [dir]`, `d` removes |
| Any panel | `m` or right-click | context menu |
| Any panel | `z` | full-screen terminal: collapse the sidebars and lock input into the attached session |
| Any panel | `e` | flip the pane to **AUTOMATION**: the selected project's tasks — a prompt plus when to run it. `n` adds one (name, then the prompt), `space` turns one on or off, `r` runs it now, `d` deletes it (asks first), `→` steps into its fields where `←/→` cycle each value |
| Automation | fields | `name`, `prompt`, `agent`, `model`, `effort`, `schedule` (cron), `iterations`, `unattended`, `run in`, `enabled` — the three text fields open an editor, the rest cycle in place. Below them: when it next runs, and what the last run did |
| Any panel | `s` | settings overlay (theme, editor, agent defaults, timeouts) — its Hotkeys tab rebinds every key in this table; `R` inside it resets everything to the defaults (with a confirmation) |
| Any panel | `Shift+M` | memory usage: RAM per agent/terminal process tree, nebula itself, and the machine-wide share; `↑/↓` + `Enter` opens the selected session |
| Any panel | `Shift+N` | replay the startup splash (any key returns) |
| Any panel | `?` | help overlay |
| Any panel | `q` / `Ctrl+c` | quit the TUI (sessions keep running) |
| Terminal | anything | forwarded raw to the PTY |
| Terminal | `Ctrl+q` | back to panels (also expands sidebars) — `Ctrl+]`, `Ctrl+Esc` and `Ctrl+←` do the same, for terminals that eat one of them |
| Terminal | mouse wheel | scrollback (arrow keys on alt-screen apps) |
| Any typed field | `←→`/`⌥←→`, `Ctrl+a`/`Ctrl+e`, `⌥⌫`, `Ctrl+u`/`Ctrl+k` | every prompt, filter and query is the same line editor: move by character / word, jump to ends, delete word, kill line |

</details>

Mouse: left-click selects/attaches, right-click opens context menus, double-click in the terminal selects
a word, `⌥`-click opens the URL or `file:line` under the cursor (browser / editor modal), and dragging a
panel border resizes it. Text selection: hold `Shift` while dragging (mouse capture bypass — same as
tmux).

## Commands

```sh
nebula                    # launch the TUI (auto-starts the daemon)
nebula --workspace <name> # launch it on a named workspace; each instance keeps its own, so
                          # two windows can sit on two workspaces at once
nebula add <dir>          # add a repo as a project, named after its root directory
nebula add .              # same, for the repo you're in (bare `nebula <dir>` / `nebula .` also work)
nebula daemon             # run the daemon (normally auto-spawned)
nebula daemon --foreground  # daemon with logs to stderr, for debugging
nebula kill               # stop the daemon and all sessions cleanly
nebula rename <title>     # title the current session (agents run this; --force to retitle)
nebula worktree [name] [--base <ref>]  # move the current session into a worktree of its project,
                          # creating the branch if it's new (agents run this when you ask for a
                          # worktree; no name invents one; --base picks a new branch's start point)
nebula workspace add <name>     # create a workspace (a named project group)
nebula workspace open <name>    # open it in the next instance you launch
nebula workspace list           # list workspaces; * marks the one new instances open into
nebula workspace rename <a> <b> # rename a workspace
nebula workspace delete <name>  # delete an empty workspace
nebula ssh <host> [dir]   # open nebula on a remote machine over ssh (installs it there if
                          # missing); destinations are remembered for the TUI's `h` picker
nebula browser [--port N] # serve this TUI in a browser tab via ttyd (loopback only) and open
                          # it; needs ttyd on PATH. With no --port it takes 7681 when that's
                          # free and a free port otherwise, saying which — so one per checkout
                          # can serve at once. --port 0 always picks a free one; --port N is
                          # that port or an error, which is what you want behind an ssh tunnel
nebula upgrade            # install the latest release (--force on a dev build)
```

## Configuration

Settings: `~/.local/share/nebula/config.json` (or the platform equivalent), beside the database —
hand-editable, and what the `s` overlay writes.

Logs: `~/.local/state/nebula/daemon.log` and `tui.log` (`NEBULA_LOG=debug` for more). `NEBULA_EDITOR`
overrides the configured editor. Overrides for tests/parallel instances: `NEBULA_RUNTIME_DIR`,
`NEBULA_DATA_DIR`, `NEBULA_AGENT_CMD`, `NEBULA_INSTALL_URL`.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release     # → target/release/nebula (~4 MB)
cargo test                # unit + end-to-end suite (spawns real daemons/PTYs)
```

Workspace layout: `nebula-core` (shared protocol/entities), `nebula-daemon` (PTYs, SQLite, hook receiver,
status engine), `nebula-tui` (ratatui client), `nebula` (the binary). `vendor/vt100` is a patched copy of
the terminal parser, wired in through `[patch.crates-io]`: rows scrolled out of a top-anchored scroll
region go to scrollback instead of being discarded, so wheel-up over a codex session has something to
show.

Releases: push a `v*` tag (`git tag v0.1.0 && git push --tags`) and CI builds mac (arm/intel) and linux
(x64/arm64, static musl) binaries and attaches them to a GitHub release — which is what `install.sh`
downloads.
